# Example config for this one (place it in .bash_profile):
#  (is_empty=false; inotifywait -m .bash_history | while read file; do if [ $(wc -l <.bash_history) -lt 1  ]; then if  [ ""$is_empty"" = false ]; then logger -i -p local5.info -t empty_bash_history ""$USER : ~/.bash_history is empty ""; is_empty=true; fi; else is_empty=false;  fi;  done ) &
#  It monitors the size of .bash_history and log the words ""empty_bash_history"" whenever a previously not empty bash_history becomes empty
#  We define an empty file as a document with 0 or 1 lines (it can be a line with only one space character for example)
#  It has two advantages over the version suggested by Patrick Bareiss  :
#    - it is not relative to the exact command used to clear .bash_history : for instance Caldera uses ""> .bash_history"" to clear the history and this is not one the commands listed here. We can't be exhaustive for all the possibilities !
#    - the method suggested by Patrick Bareiss logs all the commands entered directly in a bash shell. therefore it may miss some events (for instance it doesn't log the commands launched from a Caldera agent). Here if .bash_history is cleared, it will always be detected

While it can be used legitimately for identifying and mitigating potential security risks, it could potentially be misused by bad actors for malicious purposes. Here are some ways bad actors might try to abuse PingCastle:

Information Gathering: PingCastle can be used to enumerate and collect detailed information about an organization's AD environment, including user accounts, groups, computers, trust relationships, and more. This information could be valuable for attackers planning targeted attacks or privilege escalation.
Identifying Vulnerabilities: PingCastle can detect misconfigurations, weak permissions, and other vulnerabilities in the AD infrastructure. Malicious actors could use this information to exploit weaknesses and gain unauthorized access or elevate privileges.
Lateral Movement: PingCastle can map out trust relationships and potential paths for lateral movement within the AD environment. Attackers could use this knowledge to move laterally across the network, compromising additional systems and accounts.
Privilege Escalation: By identifying accounts with elevated privileges or excessive permissions, attackers could use PingCastle to plan and execute privilege escalation attacks, gaining higher levels of access and control.
Persistence and Backdoors: Some of PingCastle's features could potentially be abused to create backdoors or establish persistent access within the compromised AD environment.",windows,T1018,Remote System Discovery

# Example config for this one (place it in .bash_profile):
#  (is_empty=false; inotifywait -m .bash_history | while read file; do if [ $(wc -l <.bash_history) -lt 1  ]; then if  [ ""$is_empty"" = false ]; then logger -i -p local5.info -t empty_bash_history ""$USER : ~/.bash_history is empty ""; is_empty=true; fi; else is_empty=false;  fi;  done ) &
#  It monitors the size of .bash_history and log the words ""empty_bash_history"" whenever a previously not empty bash_history becomes empty
#  We define an empty file as a document with 0 or 1 lines (it can be a line with only one space character for example)
#  It has two advantages over the version suggested by Patrick Bareiss  :
#    - it is not relative to the exact command used to clear .bash_history : for instance Caldera uses ""> .bash_history"" to clear the history and this is not one the commands listed here. We can't be exhaustive for all the possibilities !
#    - the method suggested by Patrick Bareiss logs all the commands entered directly in a bash shell. therefore it may miss some events (for instance it doesn't log the commands launched from a Caldera agent). Here if .bash_history is cleared, it will always be detected
